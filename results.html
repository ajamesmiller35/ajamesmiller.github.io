            <p class="testimonial-text tt-normal">“When my wife and I went to see Timothy we were in a very dark place. I was certain that our marriage was going to end. Timothy gave us the tools we needed to fix our marriage and create a relationship that is more amazing than any thing I could have ever imagined.”<br> Male, 32</p>
            <p class="testimonial-text tt-normal">“I am very grateful for the kindness and compassion Timothy had for me and my husband when we went to see him after several family tragedies. Initially my husband and I were separated and I was battling cancer. I was exhausted and losing hope. Therapy helped us manage a lot of fear and pain. It helped us grow to the fulfilling relationship we have today!”<br> Female, 31</p>
            <p class="testimonial-text tt-normal">“Thank you for working with and helping me better understand myself and my household. The tools you’ve provided me to work with are invaluable, giving me more confidence and patience in all the relationships in my life. I have a long way to go and much more to learn, but you have done a lot to un-snarl more than a few knots I’ve created in myself.”<br> Male, 38</p>
            <p class="testimonial-text tt-normal">Thanks again for everything you have done to help me through such a major transition in my life. I don’t think I could have done it without you. I continue to recommend you to anybody and everyone I know so I hope some will take advantage of the experience and growth you gave me."<br> Female, 46</p>
            <p class="testimonial-text tt-normal">“Wow! What an amazing journey my wife and I have been on the past several months. I can hardly believe I took a flight this past weekend, after over 13 years [of battling anxiety]!! I believed I could do it. I just had no idea it would be so soon. PRAISE BE TO GOD!!! <br>Timothy, thank you so much for your help, belief, guidance and most importantly your prayers with me and for me. I have no doubt God is working through you on me and my family and others. I want to encourage you too, that you are making a difference in people’s lives. When doubt or concern arise, stay confident in God’s strength, peace and presence. Thank you for all your hard work and dedication to your profession. We sincerely appreciate it and recognize it!”<br> Male, 37</p>
